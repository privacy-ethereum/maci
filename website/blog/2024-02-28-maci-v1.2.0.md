# MACI v1.2 Release

We are pleased to announce the release of MACI - Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure - [v1.2.0](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/releases/tag/v1.2.0)!

This new release focuses on improved developer experience, security, performance and clearer documentation for users looking to learn and use MACI.

## **Background**

MACI is an application that provides privacy and collusion resistance for on-chain voting - both in a [quadratic](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html) and non-quadratic fashion. It was originally created after Vitalik's [post](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413), and has since been revisited and improved.

The participants of a voting process on MACI are 1) the voters and 2) a trusted coordinator. The coordinator is in charge of setting up the system, computing the tally of the votes and ensuring everything is done in a fair manner.

Below are MACI's main properties.

| Property             | Description                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Collusion Resistance | no one except a trusted coordinator should be certain of the validity of a vote, reducing the effectiveness of bribery. |
| Receipt-freeness     | no one can prove (besides to the coordinator) which way they voted.                                                     |
| Privacy              | no one except a trusted coordinator should be able to decrypt a vote.                                                   |
| Uncensorability      | no one — not even the trusted coordinator, should be able to censor a vote.                                             |
| Unforgeability       | only the owner of a user's private key may cast a vote tied to its corresponding public key.                            |
| Non-repudiation      | no one may modify or delete a vote after it is cast, although a user may cast another vote to nullify it.               |
| Correct execution    | no one, not even the trusted coordinator, should be able to produce a false tally of votes.                             |

MACI's effectiveness can be seen in projects such as [clr.fund](https://github.com/clrfund) and [QF](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/qf). Both are quadratic funding implementations - a mechanism which otherwise is highly susceptible to collusion and bribery.

While [MACI v1.1](/blog/maci-v1-1-1-release) has been live for a considerable amount of time, no project has currently integrated it fully. Most notably, clr.fund is working on integrating MACI v1, after having used v0.x until now. You can follow their development effort under this [GitHub branch](https://github.com/clrfund/monorepo/tree/feat/maci-v1).

This post will not focus on the technical details. We'd recommend referring to our [v1 technical introduction article](/blog/maci-1-0-technical-introduction) for a deep dive of MACI's technical details.

## **Refactoring Work**

Our top priority and focus of recent months of development time has been dedicated to improving the developer experience of MACI. We've improved this by refactoring the existing code, fixing bugs and enhancing our documentation.

The refactoring work includes the following:

1. Updating libraries to the latest version, replacing unsupported dependencies with up-to-date and actively maintained ones.
2. Refactoring the code to be standardized, modular, well-commented, and consistently formatted.
3. Fixed bugs and addressed issues reported by the community.

### **Updated libraries**

MACI has been using some custom code since its initial implementation. This includes dependencies on repositories created by one of the original MACI developers, [Koh Wei Jie](https://github.com/weijiekoh). We felt that MACI could benefit from a dependency refresh, and the use of libraries that are actively maintained. For this reason, we decided to integrate other open source libraries such as [zk-kit](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit) and [circomkit](https://github.com/erhant/circomkit) to deal with certain aspects of the protocol.

For circuit-related tasks, such as compiling circuits, generating test zkeys, and unit tests, we now use [circomkit](https://github.com/erhant/circomkit). This toolikt allows us to use well-maintained code, which fits all our circuit needs.

For logic that could be reused by other projects, such as the [Poseidon permutation](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit/tree/main/packages/poseidon-cipher) encryption and decryption code, we've outsourced this to [zk-kit](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit). This way other projects can use the code, while also help make it more battle-tested. In the coming months, we're expecting to extract as much logic as possible from MACI and include it in projects like zk-kit, where other developers could benefit from it. These efforts will continue to be tracked [here](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit/issues/131).

At [Privacy and Scaling Explorations](https://https//pse.dev/en/about) (PSE), we're all about building code that is open source and aids public goods. Thus, we feel that it's value-aligned for MACI to support these other open source projects. We plan to continue integrating with other projects where sensible, as well as contributing code that could be re-used by others in the community.

### **Code refactoring**

MACI's code has been cleaned up extensively:

- dead and redundant code has been removed
- monolithic files have been split into smaller files with to incorporate a logical structure
- code has been commented on extensively and use of automated docs generators has been integrated. This includes [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) and [solidity docgen](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/solidity-docgen).
- strong type safety has been enforced on the TypeScript components
- smart contract code has been optimized and modularized
- test suites have been revisited and extended

We are now confident that developers coming across MACI for the first time will have an easier time finding the information they need in order to utilise it.

## **New Features**

[Untitled Database](https://www.notion.so/cef18f03b0114e108239bed017a18efd?pvs=21)

### **Non-Quadratic Voting**

After years of only having quadratic voting (QV), MACI now supports non-quadratic polls. This opens up the door to integrating with DAO governance tooling, or [insert project here].

The new version of the Tally circuit (specific for non-QV), has been cut down in constraints, providing a faster experience for MACI's coordinators generating proofs of vote tallying.

We welcome projects to build on top of this feature to provide secure voting.

### **EAS and Hats Protocol Gatekeepers**

Before signing up to MACI, users would need to pass a set of criteria set by the MACI operator(s). For example, they might need to prove ownership of a certain ERC721 token, and/or prove that they have passed some sort of anti-sybil/proof of personhood check.

With the addition of these two new gatekeepers, MACI's signups can be allowed only to users holding a trusted EAS attestation, or "wearing a hat" created using Hats Protocol.

We welcome the community to come up with new and innovative ways to gatekeep access to MACI's rounds, effectively helping make MACI more sybil-resilient.

### **Documentation website**

All of MACI's documentation has been consolidated under our shiny new [website](https://maci.pse.dev/).

Moving forward, every blog release, documentation update and roadmap update will be posted on this website. Please use it as a source of truth, and please report any inconsistencies you may find, as well as any suggestions on how to make this better.

## **Security Audit and Bug Fixes**

Thanks to PSE's internal audit team and [clr.fund's](https://clr.fund/#/) core developer [yuetloo](https://github.com/yuetloo), several bugs have been identified and fixed during our refactoring work.

Most notably, MACI v1.x was vulnerable to a long-standing bug which could have allowed coordinators to censor votes. This bug was first identified by [Kyle](https://github.com/kcharbo3) and a [fix](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/pull/1170) has now been implemented. For more details, please refer to the following: TODO ADD LINK TO AUDIT REPORT

After this audit and the resulting fixes, we feel more confident with MACI and its security.

### **Trusted Setup ceremony**

Recently, we concluded our [trusted setup ceremony](https://ceremony.pse.dev/projects/Maci%20v1%20Trusted%20Setup%20Ceremony) for MACI v1.1.1. However, due to the security issues identified in the circuits, there will be need for a new ceremony. This will include the updated `[processMessages](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/blob/dev/circuits/circom/processMessages.circom)` circuit.

The artifacts for v.1.1.1 can be found on our [website](https://maci.pse.dev/docs/trusted-setup), and the `[tallyVotes](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/blob/dev/circuits/circom/tallyVotes.circom)` artifacts can still be used in production. The page will be updated at the end of the ceremony with the new production-ready zKey artifacts for the updated `[processMessages](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/blob/dev/circuits/circom/processMessages.circom)` circuit.
