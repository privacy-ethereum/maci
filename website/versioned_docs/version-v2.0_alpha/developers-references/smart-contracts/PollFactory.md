`PollFactory` is a smart contract that is used to deploy new Polls. This is used by MACI inside the `deployPoll` function.

```ts
function deploy(
    _duration,
    MaxValues calldata _maxValues,
    TreeDepths calldata _treeDepths,
    PubKey calldata _coordinatorPubKey,
    address _maci
) public virtual returns (address pollAddr) {
    /// @notice Validate _maxValues
    /// maxVoteOptions must be less than 2 ** 50 due to circuit limitations;
    /// it will be packed as a 50-bit value along with other values as one
    /// of the inputs (aka packedVal)
    if (_maxValues.maxVoteOptions >= (2 ** 50)) {
      revert InvalidMaxValues();
    }

    /// @notice deploy a new AccQueue contract to store messages
    AccQueue messageAq = new AccQueueQuinaryMaci(_treeDepths.messageTreeSubDepth);

    /// @notice the smart contracts that a Poll would interact with
    ExtContracts memory extContracts = ExtContracts({ maci: IMACI(_maci), messageAq: messageAq });

    // deploy the poll
    Poll poll = new Poll(_duration, _maxValues, _treeDepths, _coordinatorPubKey, extContracts);

    // Make the Poll contract own the messageAq contract, so only it can
    // run enqueue/merge
    messageAq.transferOwnership(address(poll));

    // init Poll
    poll.init();

    pollAddr = address(poll);
  }
```

Upon deployment, the following will happen:

- ownership of the `messageAq` contract is transferred to the deployed poll contract
