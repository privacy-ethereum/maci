# Trusted setup

MACI currently uses Groth16 zk-SNARKs written in `circom`. Teams who wish to
build on MACI may choose to perform a multi-party trusted setup. This allows
observers to have a higher degree of confidence that the coordinator cannot
generate fake proofs. Some teams, however, may forgo the trusted setup.

There are two possible reasons for doing so: if a team does not intend
to manage a large amount of value, and if their users accept that the risk of
coordinator misbehaviour is insufficient to justify doing the work of a
trusted setup. After all, MACI's security model presumes a trusted coordinator.

The [PSE team](https://pse.dev/) is making available a trusted set of zKeys for MACI's circuits,
which are available and accessible on
[p0tion's website](https://ceremony.pse.dev/projects/Maci%20v1%20Trusted%20Setup%20Ceremony).
For more info on trusted setup ceremonies please refer to p0tion's [docs](https://p0tion.super.site/).

For your convenience, here is a list of the artifacts that can be used in production:

> Please note these artifacts are generated from the most up to date version of the circom circuits, available in the [dev](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/tree/dev/circuits) branch at this time.

In any case, MACI can be relatively easily modified to support PLONK, which
does not require a circuit-specific trusted setup. Its circuits, written in
[`circom`](https://github.com/iden3/circom), are compatible with Fluidex's
[`plonkit`](https://github.com/Fluidex/plonkit) tool. The downside to using
PLONK is that proof generation is not as optimised as it is for Groth16.
