              <p>
                Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure (MACI) is a private,
                on-chain, voting system.
              </p>
              <p>
                MACI is a protocol designed to provide a highly secure e-voting
                solution. It enables organizations to conduct on-chain voting
                processes with a significantly reduced risk of cheating, such as
                bribery or collusion. MACI uses zero-knowledge proofs to
                implement a receipt-free voting scheme, making it impossible for
                anyone other than the vote coordinator to verify how a specific
                user voted. This ensures the correct execution of votes and
                allows anyone to verify the results. It's particularly
                beneficial for governance and funding events, where its
                anti-collusion mechanisms help ensure fair and transparent
                outcomes.
