Glad to have you here! It's again that time where we have a few MACI roadmap updates to share.

We’re going to take a moment to look at what we accomplished in Q3, but before we start, we would like to express our gratitude to all our collaborators and contributors to the MACI protocol.

## MACI Platform ✅

This quarter, the team continued to focus on building a comprehensive voting platform with MACI. The platform is now turning into an all-in-one solution for voting, quadratic funding, and RPGF rounds. We made the product much more stable by fixing several bugs, and plan on integrating many more features in the future.

In terms of current features, the platform supports these gating mechanisms:

- [Semaphore](https://semaphore.pse.dev/)
- [Hats Protocol](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/)
- Free for all (ie, anyone can join)
- [EAS](https://docs.attest.org/docs/)
- Merkle proof
- [Zupass](https://zupass.org/)

It now also possible to run quadratic and non quadratic voting rounds, as well as running sequential rounds on the same interface. Soon you will also be able to run multiple concurrent rounds.

With the MACI Platform, we were able to support three community rounds, [EthMexico](https://ethmexico.org/), [EthTegucigalpa](https://www.meetup.com/ethereum-tegucigalpa/), and [Cryptoversidad](https://funding.cryptoversidad.com/). All rounds completed successfully with nearly $30,000.00 distributed to several projects and individuals across the three communities. We also received a lot of great feedback that helped improve the platform overall. We couldn’t be happier to work with such wonderful collaborators and help them make a real world impact.

As always, if you're interested in running a round for your community, please get in [touch](https://discord.gg/akDcCB69)

## Coordinator Service ✅

The Coordinator Service is the ultimate automation of MACI’s main pain-points. It now includes three new features for the frontend interface to provide a very neat experience to MACI operators.

Because we prioritise robust security features whenever possible, the service does not hold any wallet seed phrase to communicate with the various chains. Instead, we implemented a flow that uses ephemeral session keys for short lived approvals, greatly decreasing the impact of a key compromise. This is all possible thanks to account abstraction features such as session keys.

With the flow described above, we implemented a deployer service to easily deploy all needed MACI contracts, as well as an endpoint to merge the MACI state and message trees, an important step required to be able to tally the results.

## Account Abstraction Exploration ✅

Together with a fellow PSE team developer, [John](https://github.com/JohnGuilding), the MACI team is working on a [fork of the MACI platform](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/hacking-pse) that implements account abstraction features, such as smart wallets and paymasters.

[This fork](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/hacking-pse) was used in PSE’s first internal hackathon, and allows PSE and EF team members to vote on their favourite hackathon project without spending a single cent from their wallet onchain.

This was a successful experiment that will prove fundamental in our future efforts to improve the MACI platform and make it even more accessible to a general “non crypto native” user base.

Stay tuned for a case study of this experiment!

## MACI Protocol Improvements ✅

The [3327 team](https://3327.io) successfully completed their [Anonymous Poll Joining grant](https://maci.pse.dev/blog/anonymous-poll-joining). This work enabled unconditional voter privacy, further strengthening user privacy in the protocol. For more details, please refer to their [blog post](https://maci.pse.dev/blog/anonymous-poll-joining).

With regard to implementing Vitalik’s latest MACI proposal [Mostly Offchain Happy Path](https://ethresear.ch/t/maci-with-mostly-off-chain-happy-path/19527/), we have not been able to start due to other priorities, however we have defined the tasks required and unblocked the epic by implementing the session keys flow on the coordinator service, so that it can be re-used for a secure relayer service.

In terms of developer experience, we always try to make it easier to onboard new developers to the protocol. As a result, we have been making improvements to the deployment tasks, documentation and smart contracts code. Now developers can more easily override deployment steps to integrate MACI's smart contracts into their own projects; and can extend smart contract functions to support custom logic.

Finally, our internal team has also been brainstorming features and improvements for MACI v3, however no plan is set in stone yet. Stay tuned for more.
