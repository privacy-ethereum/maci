MACI is designed to be used in a variety of applications where stakes are high, and we believe that governance is one of them.

## DAOs Governance

MACI, as a privacy-preserving on-chain voting protocol, enables the execution of on-chain proposals where results directly trigger smart contracts. Public voting in DAOs currently faces challenges such as vote coercion and bandwagon effects, which MACI aims to mitigate.

In 2023 Nouns DAO, Aztec and Aragon ZK Research joined to do a Private Voting Research Sprint. You can read the technical report [here](https://research.aragon.org/nouns-tech.html) and the general report [here](https://research.aragon.org/nouns.html).

## Elections

We believe MACI could eventually be used in elections, where privacy is paramount. While we are still far from implementing government elections using MACI, work is being done to start testing the waters with college student councils. We are excited to continue working on making local elections a reality, together with our community and their contribution. Stay tuned.
