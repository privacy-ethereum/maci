# Trusted setup

MACI currently uses Groth16 zk-SNARKs written in `circom`. Teams who wish to
build on MACI may choose to perform a multi-party trusted setup. This allows
observers to have a higher degree of confidence that the coordinator cannot
generate fake proofs. Some teams, however, may forgo the trusted setup.

There are two possible reasons for doing so: if a team does not intend
to manage a large amount of value, and if their users accept that the risk of
coordinator misbehaviour is insufficient to justify doing the work of a
trusted setup. After all, MACI's security model presumes a trusted coordinator.

The [PSE team](https://pse.dev/) is making available a trusted set of zKeys for MACI's circuits,
which are available and accessible on
[p0tion's website](https://ceremony.pse.dev/).
For more info on trusted setup ceremonies please refer to p0tion's [docs](https://p0tion.super.site/).

## Maci v3.0 Trusted Setup Ceremony

:::danger
Maci v3.0 Trusted Setup Ceremony has not started yet. Thus for production use cases, please use [MACI v2.0](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/maci/releases/tag/v2.5.0).
:::

## Maci v2.0 Trusted Setup Ceremony (most recent)

:::info
Maci v2.0 Trusted Setup Ceremony is now completed and the circuits can be used in production.
:::

For this release, we plan to run two ceremonies, one with smaller size circuits (more accessible to contributors) due to smaller batch sizes for proving on chain, and one with larger circuits and large batch sizes for proving. Smaller size artifacts can be used for smaller rounds or for operators that want to run everything on a local computer vs using a beefy server. On the other hand, we plan to use the artifacts with larger batch sizes for large rounds and solely on a server.

### Small Batch Size Ceremony

:::info
To download the artifacts, please run the following command from within MACI monorepo's root directory:

```bash
pnpm download-zkeys:ceremony
```

:::

Here are the **maximum** values supported by these artifacts:

**_MessageProcessor_**

- users: $2^14 = 16384$
- votes: $5^9 = 1953125$
- batch size for proving: $5^2 = 25$
- vote options: $5^3 = 125$

**_VoteTally_**

- users (ballots): $2^14 = 16384$
- batch size for proving: $2^5 = 32$
- vote options: $5^3 = 125$

### Large Batch Size Ceremony

:::info
Please note that this ceremony has not started yet. We will inform when it will start and when the artifacts are available for use.
:::

Here are the **maximum** values supported by these artifacts:

**_MessageProcessor_**

- users: $2^14 = 16384$
- votes: $5^9 = 1953125$
- batch size for proving: $5^3 = 125$
- vote options: $5^3 = 125$

**_VoteTally_**

- users (ballots): $2^14 = 16384$
- batch size for proving: $2^7 = 128$
- vote options: $5^3 = 125$

## Maci v1.2 Trusted Setup Ceremony

:::danger
Please be advised that you will not be able to use these artifacts with MACI v2.
:::

:::info
MACI v1.2 artifacts are stored on [Amazon S3](https://maci-develop-fra.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/v1.2.0/maci_artifacts_6-9-2-3_prod.tar.gz). Please either download directly, or checkout any of the maci v1.2 tags to access the artifacts using the following commands:

```bash
git checkout v1.2.5
download:ceremony-zkeys
```

:::

Here are the **maximum** values supported by these artifacts:

**_MessageProcessor_**

- users: $5^6 = 15625$
- votes: $5^9 = 1953125$
- batch size for proving: $5^2 = 25$
- vote options: $5^3 = 125$

**_VoteTally_**

- users (ballots): $5^6 = 15625$
